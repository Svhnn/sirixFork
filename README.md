# Report for Assignment 1

## Project chosen

Name: Sirix

URL: https://github.com/sirixdb/sirix/tree/main

Number of lines of code and the tool used to count it: <br/>
Total Lines: 190459 <br/>
Source Code Lines: 107800 <br/>
Disclaimer: Lines should be a bit less than this, since they were counted after we already improved 2 functions, <br/>
but it shouldn't matter since the requirement is well over 10k in either case. <br/>
Tool used: Statistics plugin in IntelliJ <br/>

Programming language: Java <br/>

## Coverage measurement

### Existing tool

<Inform the name of the existing tool that was executed and how it was executed>

There isn't a clear name of the existing tool, it's built into the IntelliJ text editor.
You can either run tests normally, debug them, or run them with coverage, which is what we did.

<Show the coverage results provided by the existing tool with a screenshot>

### Your own coverage tool

<The following is supposed to be repeated for each group member>

<Group member name>
Sven
<Function 1 name>
getBytes

<Show a patch (diff) or a link to a commit made in your forked repository that shows the instrumented code to gather coverage measurements>
https://github.com/sirixdb/sirix/commit/6e3f7603fe00d56dc8400d887cb0349e4c9619a2
https://github.com/sirixdb/sirix/commit/49243c156d3480a46da1a6abc4e5cb0a349df6a1

<Provide a screenshot of the coverage results output by the instrumentation>

<Function 2 name>

<Provide the same kind of information provided for Function 1>

## Coverage improvement

### Individual tests

<The following is supposed to be repeated for each group member>

[//]: # (<Group member name>)

<Test 1>

<Show a patch (diff) or a link to a commit made in your forked repository that shows the new/enhanced test>

<Provide a screenshot of the old coverage results (the same as you already showed above)>

[//]: # (<Provide a screenshot of the new coverage results>)

[//]: # (<State the coverage improvement with a number and elaborate on why the coverage is improved>)

<Test 2>

<Provide the same kind of information provided for Test 1>

### Overall

<Provide a screenshot of the old coverage results by running an existing tool (the same as you already showed above)>

[//]: # (<Provide a screenshot of the new coverage results by running the existing tool using all test modifications made by the group>)

## Statement of individual contributions

[//]: # (<Write what each group member did>)
